# HealthyPi v4 Arduino Library

HealthyPi v4 is a HAT for the Raspberry Pi, as well as a standalone device that can measure human vital signs.
This fork is developing the system as a standalone device that can be used in a Remote Medical assessment setting where there are no or limited local staff.
The data can be transferred via Bluetooth (BLE), Wifi or USB.

HealthyPi v4 measures the following parameters in real-time:

* Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, heart rate, and heart-rate variability
* Respiration based on impedance pneumography
* Pulse oximetry (SPO₂)
* Body temperature using a no contact InfraRed (IR) thermometer

HealthyPi 4 is affordable and accessible and the open source aspect means that it’s easy to expand upon.
